# Signature-Detection-using-Resnet
The project "Signature detection using Resnet" involves the development of a machine learning system to identify signatures in a given document. The system will be based on the Resnet architecture, a deep convolutional neural network that has been widely used for image classification and other tasks.

The goal of the project is to create a system that can accurately recognize signatures based on their visual characteristics. The system will be trained on a dataset of images containing signatures, and will be able to classify and identify signatures based on their appearance.

The system will simply identify the presence of a signature in a given document. This could be useful in a variety of applications, such as document management or legal proceedings, where the presence of a signature may need to be identified and recorded.

Overall, the project aims to develop a reliable and robust signature detection system that can accurately identify signatures in a given document.
